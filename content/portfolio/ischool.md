As a student tech for the School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin, I have the opportunity to research, design, and develop the next iteration of the School of Information's website. In my and my colleague's initial planning stages, we quickly realized it was going to be very difficult to undertake such a project on our own while simultaneously maintaining the current iSchool website.

Our solution was to recruit, manage, and mentor current UX students at the School of Information—taking advantage of the talents and unique perspectives of the iSchool community. Less experienced students have an opportunity to work on a large project and learn from their more experienced peers. Those who are more experienced benefit from practicing and showcasing their skills collaboratively, so they can not only teach others, but learn from one another.

After recruiting over 20 students, we held a Kickoff Meeting to onboard the teams, set our expectations, and provide concrete timelines and deliverables.

Our first research phase consisted of five teams:

* Competitive Evaluation
* Content Audit and Inventory
* Heuristic Evaluations and Design Recommendations
* User Interviews
* Website Analytics

Of those teams, I led the Competitive Evaluation and User Interview teams—a total of 20 students.

## User Interviews

User interviews were conducted in the School of Information Media Lab, which is a small studio that can accommodate recording both audio and video. Interviews were recorded not only to preserve the conversations between the researchers and the participants to be analyzed later, but to capture the affect of the participants and their reactions as well.

Four different kinds of users have been interviewed:

* Current Students
* International Students
* Faculty
* Staff

These interviews are currently being conducted, after which the data will be analyzed. Our goals for these interviews are to capture the various personas for whom we are designing as well as to source tasks and participants for future card sorts and tree tests.

## Competitive Analysis

I recruited first year students to aid in the competitive evaluation of other School of Information websites. I was able to focus their enthusiasm and willingness to learn by creating a Sketch file template with explicit quality attributes with example questions to guide them in the proper direction.

* Navigation and Information Architecture
* Accessibility and Simplicity
* Use of Media (Photos, Graphics, Videos)
* Mobile-first and Responsiveness
* Page Layout
* Aesthetic and Visual Design


Each student, including myself, evaluated three different iSchool websites, for a total of 24. I guided students in the process and fielded any questions they had as they worked. After they were all completed, I audited the analyses for consistency and accuracy. Finally, I quantified the qualitative data with each attribute receiving a score from 0-3 for each metric. I totaled the scores for each website and then ranked and color-coded them in a spreadsheet.

With this data, I created a visual representation with polygonal graphs. The shape of the polygon is determined by the website's score for each attribute, and its color is determined by its total score—green is above average, yellow is average, and red is below average.

This provides a striking visual presentation for stakeholders that makes it clear that the iSchool's website is due for a redesign. It also presents the metrics by which the site was evaluated and its rank in terms of competing sites. For the team going forward, this provides us with standards by which we will measure our success. Rather than being average in every attribute, we will redesign the site so that it scores high marks in every category by which we are measuring it.
