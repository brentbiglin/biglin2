I met with a local non-profit interested in updating their website both functionally and aesthetically. After researching their current website, I came up with the following diagram of their site's information architecture.

After meeting with the executive director of the organization, I learned her vision for the site, what she wanted to improve about the current site, and what websites she saw as examples of good design. She was able to share websites of competitors as well, and her thoughts on their designs and functionality.

I then conducted a competitive analysis of two other sites for charities that promote the construction of wells in other countries and solicit donations from philanthropists.

The preceding site in particular gave me a great idea how to frame the concept of a "campaign" for Water to Thrive. Anyone can create a campaign for themselves, their organization, or their community and then encourage donations. The money raised for the campaign is used by Water to Thrive to create a well in the name of that particular campaign. The organization "Charity Water" uses the term "fundraise" in order to convey the concept of starting a campaign, which I believe works much better than "start a campaign," which will likely have political connotations for the user.

After discussing this research with my design team, I created a new site map, which was used to create the architecture of the website on the WordPress theme of the client's choosing.
