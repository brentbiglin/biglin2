As one of the founding board members of the User Experience Professionals Association University of Texas at Austin student chapter, I am fortunate to take on the role of the Communications Lead. I deal with regular communications to our student chapter members and UXPA International's board--in particular, [Brian Mills](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianmills/), Director of Chapters, and [Kendell Warner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kendellwarner/), Regional Director of North America.

Another responsibility of the Communications Lead is to maintain and, in the case of a chapter that's just been founded, create a website to serve as a digital home for the chapter. I created [this site](https://uxpautaustin.org) with the static site generator, [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The [source code](https://github.com/brentbiglin/uxpa-ut-austin) is hosted on GitHub, and the site is built and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I created a logo and icons that are consistent with UXPA's branding with a little UT flavor.

Our UXPA UT Austin student chapter is the second of its kind, and serves UX students at the University of Texas generally and the School of Information specifically through mentorship, UX events and workshops, and by acting as a bridge between the UX student community and the international UX industry.

We're excited to be a resource for students, but we're also looking forward to collaborating and working with our chapter's older sibling, the [UXPA Austin](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-User-Experience-Professionals-Association/) chapter.
