## Augmented Reality Navigation

I was on a team that created a video mock-up for an augmented reality navigation application to help students find and navigate to their courses at the beginning of each semester. This can be very difficult and stressful for new students, particularly at a large university with an immense campus like UT Austin.

We first had to figure out how we were going to film the video so that we could add an augmented reality overlay afterwards. We knew that we would use a GoPro camera for the primary shot, and that the phone would be held in front of this camera to demonstrate the use of the application. On the phone, we experimented with recording video on both the GoPro and the phone at the same time, but found that the camera's on-screen options would get in the way. It was also difficult for the software to track the phone so that we could add the software on top of it.

To do this, we discovered that the phone must have a green screen and fixed points so that it could be tracked by the software. We then tried recording on one phone while a second phone displaying a green screen was attached to it, but had trouble synchronizing the recordings and being sure that the camera's phone was recording video.

Then I found an application that would record video in the background of the phone while a green screen application was open on the phone's display. This did the trick. Two takes were necessary because the phone's display had to be at maximum brightness while outside, but at the lowest brightness while inside to avoid glare.

I undertook the filming and hand/wrist modeling, as well as aided in the final editing, audio, and call-out components of the video using Camtasia and Adobe After Effects CC. This was the final result.
