I am a student of UX design, research, and information architecture at the University of Texas at Austin School of Information. My background in teaching and advising gives me insight into how to turn raw data into information that users can find, understand, and turn into knowledge.

I hold a Master's degree in Arabic Language and Literature and a Bachelor's degree in Cultural Studies and Arabic with a minor in Security and Intelligence. I utilize my interdisciplinary training to develop human-centered information architectures and designs. Advocacy for and fostering understanding among and between people has been the common thread throughout my professional career.
