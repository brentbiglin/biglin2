I am a student of UX design and information architecture at the University of Texas at Austin School of Information. My background in teaching and advising gives me insight into how to turn raw data into information that users can find, understand, and turn into knowledge. My experiences in different professional roles throughout my life have fostered in me an instinct for when to apply time-tested and reliable principles, and when to shift the paradigm and challenge the status quo.

I hold a Master's degree in Arabic Language and Literature and a Bachelor's degree in Cultural Studies and Arabic with a minor in Security and Intelligence. I utilize my interdisciplinary training to develop human-centered information architectures and designs. Advocacy for and fostering understanding among and between people has been the common thread throughout my professional career. I leverage my skills to push not only my own boundaries, but those of design and innovation—and ways that the design community can be a positive force in the world.

The projects featured in my portfolio showcase my research skills and natural eye for clean and elegant design, as well as my dedication to always be learning something new: [resume](/img/Brent-Biglin-Resume.pdf).
